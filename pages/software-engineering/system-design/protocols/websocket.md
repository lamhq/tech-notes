# WebSocket

## Overview

WebSocket is a communications protocol built on top of TCP.

It that allows simultaneous two-way communication between client and server.

It maintains a persistent connection, enabling continuous data exchange.

Ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, live updates, and online gaming.

It works over standard HTTP ports (80 and 443), making it easier to integrate with existing web infrastructure.


## Disadvantages

WebSocket is more complicated to implement than HTTP. They require additional effort to:
- manage connections
- design message structure
- parse messages
- handle errors

If a network error occurs, the connection will be dropped, require client to reconnect.

WebSocket have some issues with load balancers:
- Since WebSockets are stateful and need persistent connections, load balancers must employ sticky sessions. This ensures that all requests from a given client are routed to the same server.
- Load balancers need to use TCP-based health checks instead of HTTP health checks to more effectively monitor WebSocket connections.
- When scaling up or down, existing WebSocket connections may not be efficiently redistributed, leading to uneven load distribution
