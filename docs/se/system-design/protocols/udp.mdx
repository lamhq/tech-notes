# UDP

## Overview

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a core communication protocol in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite.

Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking.

Due to its simplicity, UDP has lower overhead, making it suitable for applications where speed is crucial.

UDP is commonly used for time-sensitive applications, where occasional data loss is acceptable, such as:
- video streaming
- monitoring metrics
- online gaming
- DNS lookups


## TCP vs. UDP

| ТСР | UDP |
|---|---|
| Slow | Fast |
| Expects confirmation from the Receiver | Just sends packets of information |
| Numbers each message | Good when there's a constant stream of data |
| Most common networking protocol |  |
