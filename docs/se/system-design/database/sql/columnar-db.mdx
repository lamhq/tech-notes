# Columnar Databases

## Overview

Columnar DBs are column-oriented databases.

OLAP applications compute analytical properties from columns (attributes). They require optimized column-read operations on tables.

Columnar databases are designed for high-throughput of column aggregations. 

RDBMS does not scale to the level required for Big Data analytics applications.

Modern Data Warehouses are built on Columnar databases. Data is stored by columns instead of by rows.

Available choices are:

- AWS: RedShift
- Azure: Synapse
- Google Cloud: BigQuery
- Apache: Druid, Kudu, Pinot
- Others: ClickHouse, Snowflake
