# Wide-column Database

Wide-column databases are a type of NoSQL database that organizes data into flexible columns.

Columns (including name and type) may be different for each row in the same table.

Each data entry is identified by a unique combination of row key, column name, and timestamp:
- Allows for each row to have a different set of columns, which can be very large in number (hence "wide-column").
- The timestamp can be used for versioning data.

This flexible schema allows for efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of data across multiple servers, making it highly scalable.

Itâ€™s particularly useful for big data applications where data volume can be enormous.

Wide-column databases are row-oriented databases.

Options:
- Apache HBase was the first open-source wide-column datastore.
