# Transaction

## Overview

A database transaction is a sequence of one or more operations performed on database data. It is treated as a single, indivisible unit, ensuring that either all operations within it are successfully completed, or none are. 

This all-or-nothing approach provides reliability and security to the data operations.

Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time).

Transactions adhere to the ACID properties to maintain integrity in the database system.


## ACID properties

These properties are designed to ensure that database transactions are processed reliably.

- **Atomicity**: This property ensures that all operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit, which either completely succeeds or fails.
- **Consistency**: A transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining the integrity of the data.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.


## Transactional databases

Transactional databases are systems that support database transactions with ACID properties, ensuring data integrity and consistency across multiple operations.

They allow multiple users to access and modify the database concurrently without leading to data conflicts or corruption. 

Examples include relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

Transactions are available in most SQL database implementations.


## Distributed Transactions

Distributed transactions are complex processes where a single transaction spans across multiple databases or different nodes within a network, ensuring that all involved databases maintain the ACID properties despite being distributed.

A distributed transaction might include systems such as databases, storage managers, file systems, messaging systems, and other data managers.

In a distributed transaction there is typically an entity coordinating all the process to ensure that all parts of the transaction are applied to all relevant systems.

Some DBMS that support distributed transactions include:
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL (with extensions like Postgres-XL)
- MySQL Cluster
- IBM DB2
