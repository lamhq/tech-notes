# Truthy Values

JavaScript has a concept of `truthy` i.e. things that evaluate like `true` would in certain positions (e.g. `if` conditions and the boolean `&&` `||` operators)


| Variable Type   | When it is *falsy*       | When it is *truthy*      |
|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| `boolean`       | `false`                  | `true`                   |
| `string`        | `''` (empty string)      | any other string         |
| `number`        | `0`  `NaN`               | any other number         |
| `null`          | always                   | never                    |
| `undefined`     | always                   | never                    |
| Any objects, including `{}`,`[]` | never | always |


## The `!!` pattern

You can easily convert values to a true boolean by prefixing it with `!!` e.g. `!!foo`.
