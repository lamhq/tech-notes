## What's a Story

A story captures the rendered state of a UI component.

Developers write multiple stories per component that describe all the “interesting” states a component can support.


## Using stories

Here's the workflow to use Storybook:

- 🗃 Use the sidebar to find a suitable component
- 👀 Review its stories to pick a variant that suits your needs
- 📝 Copy/paste the story definition into your app code and wire it up to data


## Component Story Format

Component Story Format (CSF) is an ES6 module-based standard for writing stories in Storybook by using JavaScript objects and modules.


## Writting Story

```tsx title="Button.stories.ts|tsx"
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { Button } from './Button';

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  component: Button,
};
export default meta;

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>;

export const Primary: Story = {
  // 👇 Rename this story (optional)
  name: 'I am the primary',
  args: {
    primary: true,
    label: 'Button',
  },
};

export const Secondary: Story = {
  args: {
    ...Primary.args,
    label: '😄👍😍💯',
  },
};
```
- The `default export` metadata controls how Storybook lists your stories and provides information used by addons.
- Use the **named exports** to define your component’s stories (UpperCamelCase is preferred).

You can [import args](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories#:~:text=you%20can%20import%20args%20to%20reuse%20when%20writing%20stories%20for%20other%20components) from other stories to reuse when writing stories for other components,

Each of the args from the story can be edited in the UI using Storybook’s [Controls panel](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/controls).

[Actions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/actions) auto-detects which args are callbacks and appends a logging function to them.


## Create stories (UI)

To create a new story, you can click the `➕` button in the sidebar to search for your component.

To add new story from an existing story, you can use the [Controls addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/controls) to adjust the value of a control and then save those changes as a new story.


## Edit a story

Using the Controls addon, update a control's value for a story. You can then save the changes to the story and the story file's code will be updated for you.
