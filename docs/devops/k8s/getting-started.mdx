# Getting Started

## Installation

minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes.

### Install minikube

Install minikube on macOS (ARM64) using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install minikube
```

### Install kubectl 

`kubectl` is the command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

minikube already has a pre-installed version of `kubectl` that you can use like this:

```sh
minikube kubectl -- get po -A
```

You can make a command alias by adding this to your shell config (`~/.zshrc`):
```sh
alias kubectl="minikube kubectl --"
```


## Start cluster

Start cluster with Podman (rootless mode):

```sh
minikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=containerd
```
- `--container-runtime=containerd` is recommended for rootless Podman

To make podman the default driver:
```sh
minikube config set driver podman
```

Configure minikube to use rootless mode:
```sh
minikube config set rootless true
```


## Deploy a sample application

```sh
kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080
```

Wait a moment, your deployment will soon show up when you run:
```sh
kubectl get services hello-minikube
```

Launch a web browser and opens the URL for the service:
```sh
minikube service hello-minikube
```


## Cleanup

Halt the cluster:
```sh
minikube stop
```

Delete all of the minikube clusters:
```sh
minikube delete --all
```


Pause Kubernetes without impacting deployed applications:
```sh
minikube pause
```

Resume:
```sh
minikube unpause
```
