# Kubernetes

## Overview

Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services


## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes provides you with a framework to manage containers in a production environment.

It allows you to run distributed systems, handling scaling, failover, deployment patterns, ... 

Key Features:

- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** A container can be exposed using DNS or IP address.Kubernetes balances and distributes network traffic between containers to maintain stable deployments during high traffic.
- **Storage Orchestration:** Automatically mounts storage systems of your choice.
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:** automatically change the container's state to your desired state.
- **Automatic Bin Packing:** Kubernetes can fit containers onto your available nodes to make the best use of your resources.
- **Self-Healing:** Kubernetes restarts/replaces/kills unhealthy containers
- **Secret and Configuration Management:** you can store and manage sensitive information securely.
- **Batch Execution:**  Kubernetes can manage batch and CI workloads, replacing failing containers if needed.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scales applications up or down with manually or automatically (based on CPU usage).
- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack:** Allocates IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services.
- **Designed for Extensibility:** Adds features without changing source code. 


## Core Components

### Control Plane

The central management entity that maintains the desired state of the cluster and orchestrates the containerized applications
- **Maintaining Cluster State**: ensures that the cluster's state matches the desired state.
- **Managing Workloads**: decides which nodes will run the workloads and ensures they are running as expected.
- **Network Policies**: manages network policies to ensure secure and efficient communication between different components of the cluster.
- **Scaling and Resilience**: enables automatic scaling of applications based on demand and maintains the desired system state even in the face of failures.

The control plane consists of several key components:
- **kube-apiserver**: the core component server that exposes the Kubernetes HTTP API.
- **etcd**: a consistent and highly-available key-value store that holds the configuration data of the cluster.
- **kube-scheduler**: determines which node a new or modified Pod should run on.
- **kube-controller-manager**: runs a set of controllers to ensure the desired state matches the current state.
- **Cloud Controller Manager**: integrates with the underlying cloud provider.


### Node Components

A Node is a worker machine in the cluster

- **Running Pods**: Nodes are responsible for running Pods, which are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Each Pod contains one or more containers.
- **Runs essential services** that ensure proper functionality and communication with the control plane
- **Manage resources**: CPU, memory, and storage, and allocate them to Pods
- **Health Monitoring**: monitor the health of the services and containers they run
- **Logging and Metrics Collection**: collecting logs and metrics from the running containers

Node services:
- **kubelet**: ensures that Pods are running, communicate with the Kubernetes API server.
- **kube-proxy**: manage the network rules that allow communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.
- **Container Runtime**: software responsible for running containers (Docker, containerd, and CRI-O, ...)
