# Kubernetes

## Overview

Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services


## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes provides you with a framework to manage containers in a production environment.

It allows you to run distributed systems, handling scaling, failover, deployment patterns, ... 

Key Features:

- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** A container can be exposed using DNS or IP address.Kubernetes balances and distributes network traffic between containers to maintain stable deployments during high traffic.
- **Storage Orchestration:** Automatically mounts storage systems of your choice.
- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:** automatically change the container's state to your desired state.
- **Automatic Bin Packing:** Kubernetes can fit containers onto your available nodes to make the best use of your resources.
- **Self-Healing:** Kubernetes restarts/replaces/kills unhealthy containers
- **Secret and Configuration Management:** you can store and manage sensitive information securely.
- **Batch Execution:**  Kubernetes can manage batch and CI workloads, replacing failing containers if needed.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Scales applications up or down with manually or automatically (based on CPU usage).
- **IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack:** Allocates IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services.
- **Designed for Extensibility:** Adds features without changing source code.
